# Testing an online store
## Training project https://hexlet-products-store.vercel.app/

## Description:

Developed a store interface for selling products with browsing, filtering products and adding them to cart. The key feature of the store will be adaptive layout so that it will be user friendly on mobile devices. Also, the store is a SPA application that does not reload the page. The user can browse through the product catalog, filtering the products and taking advantage of the page-by-page output.

The product page and catalog displays the name, rating, discounted and non-discounted price. The user can add a product to the cart and continue selecting products in the catalog.

On the cart page the user can remove an item from the cart, continue selecting items in the catalog, place an order with a transition to the payment page. The cart is stored in the browser session.
